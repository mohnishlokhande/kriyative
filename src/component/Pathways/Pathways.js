With all this and much more in mind, Kriyative has designed a holistic learning frame-work. Apart from the self-explanatory teacher’s guides that are provided for each lesson, creative freedom is given for teachers to experiment and come up with their own activities for teaching.</p>

                            <p className="details">With the idea to help teachers acknowledge the uniqueness of each child and help each learn in their way, a list of activities – such as Role play, Question and Answer sessions, Lab work – have been suggested to inculcate differentiated learning styles among students.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p className="details">Visually appealing illustrations have been added to all learning modules, to not only have rapt attention of the students, but to also engage a class discussion to allow students to express themselves. All these modules have remained loyal to all pre-requisites of the Wheel of Kriya. Therefore, the five stages of learning have been incorporated into the modules provided. For instance, thoroughly prepared question bank and assessment guides have been carefully created for a complete assessment. The modules have been concocted with attention to detail and are aligned to guide in smooth teaching-learning process.</p>
